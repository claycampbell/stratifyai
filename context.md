Refer to the below conversation which gives a brief idea about the AI Powered OGSM Management platform project

" Please refer to the documents provided in Fw_Documents for Phase Zero folder to kick off the AI Chief Strategy Officer project. It is about deploying this AI-powered assistant to streamline our operations, anticipate trends, and amplify the strategic capacity of our Athletics Cabinet.

Phase Zero of this project will concentrate on strategic and operational planning, leadership efficiency, and operational excellence. To assist with this, I've attached the following documents for your review

The Robert Morris University Athletics FY26 Strategic Plan of Action.

The FY26 Athletics Cabinet Master Tracker Spreadsheet.

The Weekly Athletics Cabinet Strategy Tracker for FY26 Core Priority weekly progress updates.

A key strategic initiative for our department is to transition Asana from solely an external operations tool to a comprehensive project management system for all our athletic units. Stephen heads up the Asana project management."

So basically we want to build an AI Powered OGSM Management platform where all work will be done by AI like analysis, processing etc. Please use GEMINI model for the same. Make sure core components are handled by AI. We also need to containerize it so we can cloud deploy. Please also generate README which will give set up instructions and brief about the project and its functions.

Here is the transcript of the meeting where the project idea was discussed:

Here’s what was discussed for the initial pilot features:
1. Build an AI Chief Strategy Officer/bot to help with top strategic and operational priorities
2. Streamline key workflows for senior staff, focusing on things they’d delegate if possible
3. Integrate with existing internal data like schedules, budgets, recruiting info, staff and leadership roles, and performance metrics
4. Support planning processes, including annual and long-range planning tied to KPIs
5. Use and help update standard operating procedures (SOPs) for different roles/departments
6. Improve compliance management and connect with compliance manuals and reporting procedures
7. Enable secure access and proper permissions, especially with sensitive student-athlete and donor data
8. Potential integration with Asana and Sprout Social for project and social media management
9. Focus on quick, impactful wins that show ROI right away in “Phase Zero”
10. Allow for future reduction or consolidation of existing software tools where possible

Please build this entire initial pilot project AI Chief Strategy (i.e the AI OGSM Management platform)
