## 📋 Quick Start: Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Create Your Fiscal Plan

2. Add optional descriptions for context
3. Click "Complete Setup"

✅ **Result:** Your fiscal plan is created and ready for strategy generation

---

### Step 3: Generate AI Strategies
**Location:** Fiscal Plan Detail Page → "Generate AI Strategies"

The AI will analyze your priorities and create detailed strategies with:
- Implementation steps
- Required resources

- Supporting evidence

**Process:**
1. Click "Generate AI Strategies"
2. Select which priorities need strategies
3. Provide context (budget, constraints, goals)
4. Click "Generate Strategies"
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for AI to create strategies

✅ **Result:** Draft strategies appear under each priority

### Step 4: Review & Approve Strategies
**Location:** Fiscal Plan Setup → View Draft Strategies

Each strategy shows:
- **Title** - What the strategy aims to achieve
- **Description** - How it will be implemented
- **Status Badge** - Draft, Under Review, Approved, or Rejected

**To Approve:**
1. Click "Review Strategies" from detail page
2. Review each draft strategy under its priority
3. Click ✅ **green checkmark** to approve
4. Click 🎯 **red icon** to reject

**Best Practice:** Approve strategies that align with budget, resources, and organizational capacity

✅ **Result:** Approved strategies are ready for conversion to formal OGSM components

---

### Step 5: Create KPIs (Optional but Recommended)
**Location:** AI Strategy Generator or Fiscal Plan Setup

Before converting to OGSM, create KPIs to track strategy success:

**To Create KPIs:**
1. Find an approved strategy with success metrics
2. Click "Create KPIs" button
3. Review pre-populated success metrics
4. Fill in:
   - **Target Value** (e.g., 5000)
   - **Unit** (e.g., "tickets", "%", "$")
   - **Frequency** (monthly, quarterly, annual)
5. Select/deselect KPIs to create
6. Click "Create Selected KPIs"

**Example KPI:**
- Name: "Increase hockey ticket sales"
- Target: 5000
- Unit: "tickets"
- Frequency: "monthly"

✅ **Result:** KPIs are created and trackable in KPI Dashboard

---

### Step 6: Convert Strategies to OGSM
**Location:** Fiscal Plan Detail Page → Blue Alert Banner

Once you have approved strategies, convert them to formal OGSM framework:

**Visual Indicator:**
- Blue banner appears: "Ready to Convert Strategies"
- Shows count of approved strategies ready

**To Convert:**
1. Click "Convert to OGSM" button
2. Review strategies in modal (organized by priority)
3. All strategies are pre-selected
4. Optionally deselect strategies to convert later
5. Click "Convert to OGSM"

**What Happens:**
- Strategies become formal OGSM components
- They appear in your OGSM View
- "Converted" count increases in dashboard
- Strategies are marked as "converted" (can't be edited)

✅ **Result:** Strategies are now part of your official OGSM strategic framework

---

### Step 7: Activate Your Plan
**Location:** Fiscal Plan Detail Page → "Activate Plan" button

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ All approved strategies must be converted to OGSM
- ⚠️ System will prevent activation if unconverted approved strategies remain

**To Activate:**
1. Ensure all approved strategies are converted
2. Click "Activate Plan" in top-right
3. Confirm activation

**What Happens:**
- Previous fiscal plan status changes to "completed"
- New plan becomes the active fiscal year plan
